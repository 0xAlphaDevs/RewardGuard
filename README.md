## Introduction

- This proposal outlines the implementation of a Sybil-resistant system for distributing protocol rewards and airdrops.

- By utilizing proof of machinehood within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), we aim to ensure that only legitimate participants receive rewards, thereby enhancing the security and fairness of the process.

## Background

- Sybil Attacks lead to unfair distribution of rewards, reduced trust, and compromised network security.

- Current solutions are resource-intensive, inconvenient for users, and not entirely foolproof.

## Proposed Solution

- Using Trusted Execution Environmets(TEEs) to enable secure execution and hardware level attestations for proof of on-chain activity.

- Proofs can be settled on Automata Network to ensure integrity of the participating machines.

- Later, we can cross-verify machinehood proofs using multiple TEEs to ensure robustness and filter sybils.

## Why TEEs and Proof of Machinehood?

- **_Fair Distribution_** : Using PoM, RewardGuard ensures that only legitimate participants receive rewards, preventing Sybil attackers from gaining an unfair advantage.

- **_Scalability & Low cost_** : TEEs provide a scalable and low cost solution that can handle a large number of participants and verifications efficiently.

- **_Verifiable Machine Trust_** : The verifiable nature of TEEs and the Automata Network enhances the overall trustworthiness of the reward distribution process.
